# ChARM station configuration files

This repo contains configuration files for [srsLTE (now srsRAN)](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN) to create two cells managed by the same eNB (mobile station).
These configuration files have been optimized to be used on the [Colosseum](https://www.northeastern.edu/colosseum/) channel emulator.
The configuration in the folder _charm_, has been used for experimenting with the ChARM project [1].
